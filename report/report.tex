\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The abstract paragraph should be indented 1/2~inch (3~picas) on both left and
right-hand margins. Use 10~point type, with a vertical spacing of 11~points.
The word \textbf{Abstract} must be centered, bold, and in point size 12. Two
line spaces precede the abstract. The abstract must be limited to one
paragraph.

\section{Introduction}
In introduction, you should first introduce the problem of learning with label noise, and then its significance and applications. You should give an overview of the methods you want to use.

\section{Related work}
In related work, you are expected to review the main idea of related label noise methods (including their advantages and disadvantages).

\section{Methods}
In methods, you should describe the details of the flip rate estimation methods, include objective function, theoretical foundations (if any), and optimization algorithms. You should also describe the details of your classification models, including the formulation of the cost functions, the theoretical foundations or views (if any) of the cost functions, and the optimization methods.

\section{Experiments}
In experiments, you should introduce your experimental setup (e.g.,datasets, algorithms, evaluation metric, etc.). Then, you should show the experimental results, compare, and analyze your results. If possible, give your personal reflection or thoughts on these results.

\subsection{Datasets}

\subsection{Algorithms}

\subsection{Evaluation metrics}

\subsection{Discussion}

\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, you should summarize your methods, results, and your insights for the future work.
